        again. it is happening again. i had thought we were through, but i got a call from Steev last week. he seemed frantic, disturbed even. he kept going on about how we had to go back, we had to return to the park. i wasn't sure how i felt about that, i sort of prefer my affairs to have some sense of closure. but Steev was insistent. so i guess this one's for you, Steev.
        <br><br>
        this time around, the team has come to a consensus on a couple things:
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>we're starting over. when we started last time, we had no idea what the end goal was. dumpling.love as we knew it was an experiment, & now it's time to refine that experiment. construct something with <i>intention.</i> most of the new website is going to be copy-pasted from the old one, but there are whole swathes which need to be rewritten for both logistical reasons & to satisfy our arcane design.</li>
            <li>part of starting again is using collage elements which we own. much of the visuals on the last website are (heavily-processed) jetsam, washed up on the shores of the internet. now we're making all of it ourselves, with a more careful consideration to its visual composition. "lost" is no longer an acceptable default experience. there may be the occasional park-goer who delights in losing their self to the net, but we need to make that an enticing option instead of an alien norm.</li>
            <li>one of our other motivations is that we have no subtractive process in our design. we have no methods for removing something which has been created. law of conservation of hyperlinks, i guess. so in order to "edit" or "draft" the park, we need to iterate. the old park won't be destroyed-- i don't know if it can be destroyed, actually-- we'll just create a new primary space.</li>
        </ol>
        Steev was of course nowhere to be seen at the meetings where we decided this. i'd be worried if i wasn't already so tired on his behalf. whatever. i guess we'll figure it out without him (again).
