    (I keep thinking that it might be a cool idea to make an html version of cadavre exquis (There's even a head and
    a

      We in order to solve the issues and get some benefits of making it with digital paper, we came up with the
      <em>watermelon
        fork method </em> (someone will eventually change this parenthesis to the computer science concept that is
      actually that,
      but
      I am too lazy to try to remember now). It was as the follows:
      Each person reacted to the posted link with a watermelon once they started
      their
      drawing and with a fork
    </p>

        alt="an image showing a free to be taken image in the watermelon fork method">
    </a>
    <!-- (TODO: make this image a thing that actually can be clicked and increases watermelons and forks -->
    <!-- (TODO: make the link only work when there are more watermelons than forks-->
    <ul>
      <li>
        Each person created their own initial drawing in aggie.io choosing the size, background color (and any other
        parameters you could have for the seed)
      </li>
      <li>
        Within their own created drawing a person game up with some initial drawing and figures out a way to create a
        mask
        to work as the hidden information part of the cadavre exquis game. (a benefit of the digital is it's as
        cumbersome
        to create these masks as it is to "fold" a chunk of the paper back to hide a part of the drawing). ((Ideally
        they
        should've created a mask that the next person can understand and pass on, but the tension of understanding it
        is))
        also fun.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once each person had created their seed, they could share the link to it in our messaging app with a reaction
        feature. Then they could go continue someone elses drawing and before going through the link react with a
        watermelon 🍉. Therefore, if a link had a watermelon, someone was working on it.
      <li>
        Once they finished their part of the drawing and covered it with how they understood the mask worked, they would
        go back to discord and react with a fork 🍴, demonstrating that they had finished eating the watermelon 🍉
      </li>

        We are unsure if this method works with other emojis, if you test it out and it does, please send us a pull
        request modifying the following <b>List of emojis for which the <em>watermelon fork method</em> is tested and
