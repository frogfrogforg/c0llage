    Wow, you're using the website! {yes}
    You've been at it for a while... but if you're feeling excited, keep going. There's still so much more to click on, I promise. {}
    [cont] I guess I should probably tell you soon... {huh | what}
    [cont] ...you've just used your 100 free clicks, you see. {my...}
    [cont] Your free clicks. {my clicks}
    [cont] From here on out, each click will cost you 1Â¢. {...}
    [cont] I'm sorry, I don't make the rules. I don't really even enforce the rules. You'll have to take that one up with the parks staff... {.}
    [cont] ...but I can help you settle up your debts to them. {how | no}
