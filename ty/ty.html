        <h1>we solved <span class="Problem">The Problem</span> (maybe, for now anyways), or <em>pt. 1 of an excerpt from a draft of chapter 1 of the little forest book of good business</em></h1>

        <p>earlier posts on this page characterize <span class="Problem">The Problem</span> as the tension that exists in group work between expressing invidiual voices and expressing a single, collective voice. i'm not sure that sums it up.</p>

        <p>this characterization presents <span class="Problem">The Problem</span> as something discrete, something a bit too articulable. i think it hews closer to the trouble of navigating the ineffable rules of collaboration that are unique to each group of people (this page also says something like that). of developing an un/spoken understanding of the shared Values & Principles within a group. as such, it's not totally replicable (but maybe it is partially replicable). between any two groups, the rules will be different and must be navigated differently. i'm beginning to feel like doing this sort of work is what makes <em>any</em> creative work possible, intelligible.</p>

        <p>triangulating those shared Values & Principles is kinda obviously important, but in my other work experiences it has been sidelined in favor of the more exciting Making Stuff. and Making stuff is hard, so we seek readymade Practices in pursuit of making Making Stuff possible, intelligible. reflecting on these past few months, if we solved <span class="Problem">Our (Spatially, Temporally Local) Problem</span> it was by not doing that. what we and our teachers have called our "committment to process" has, as i see it, really been a committment to not leaping straight past values-triangulation and into design. in other classes, if we tried to identify shared values at all, we did we did so tangentially. as a second priority to Making Stuff. via a processes with strict constraints that produced a set of values nonrepresentative of any subgroup, much less any individual. unearthing values is difficult and time-consuming. once they're found, they require constant re-excavation and reaffirmation to avoid going stale.</p>

        <p>did we just get lucky? probably a little bit. as bennett pointed out, our success may be limited to this particular point in time, the particular place in life that we all happen to be in. that would be okay (would it?). small teams formed from well-established relationships probably benefit from luck in that that allows them to avoid some of the in-project work necessary to figure out where their shared values lie. ideally, friendship did that. when those values shift though, my guess that not having done the upfront work can become a real burden. unvoiced pain, things getting harder over time, the team missing a professional muscle to reckon with it. we formed semi-organically, and i wouldn't say we had <em>well</em>-established relationships. but we benefited a bit from this luck. we could have found irreconcilable gaps in our values. we haven't found those gaps. yet?</p>

        <p>i choose to believe that it wasn't totally luck. that this wasn't some perfect confluence of time and place. maybe i'll eat those words. i think we have done a lot of work. developed a bunch of practices that have helped us triangulate our values. i realized today that we've approached it backwards (in terms of granularity, not in the normative sense), starting from a meta-level committment to iterating on our Practices in order to reverse engineer our shared Values & Principles. i think that may be why many of the Values & Principles we're riding on right now feel like unspoken rules. becuase we found them through processes that often obviated directly speaking about them. maybe it's easier to start there, rather than diving directly into being totally earnest about your thoughts and feelings and Values and Principles with people with whom you don't yet have those well-established relationships.

        <p>at least in part, i think this is how we've been able to avoid thus far being consumed by <span class="Problem">The Problem</span>. but i also realized today that we still have a lot of work to do. a lot of muscles to build, strengthen if we want to avoid getting torn apart. and maybe now we have relationships with one another that will allow us to engage more directly with our Values & Principles. i love this project, team, and everyone on it as individuals. a lot. it's been the most rewarding collaborative experience of my life, hands down. i think that it is important, that love, to our particular Values & Principles.</p>

        <p>this post went a little off the rails. i sat down to write about how, when people start organizations, if they do any value-triangulation it is usually when the organization starts and/or only for the inner circle. those values calcify into Practices that they then inflict violently on others who aren't values-aligned in the interest of "scaling". that'll be the next one i guess, i want to stop writing now.</p>

        <p>p.s. this inspired by a topic in another class (and some current events). in games, i feel like one such set of violent Practices is "design frameworks". a means for a games org to disseminate its Values & Principles to fledgling designers without requiring they share them. for telling them what values they and the game <em>must</em> evince. it's not about being some enlightened buddha, it's about caring about your collaborators' values  first and the game's design second.<p>

        <p>p.p.s. in software engineering, we often call these calcified pratices "Agile" (capital-A) or "scrum". i think if you find shared Values & Principles, then useful Practices follow naturally. and this, in my view, is "agile" (lowercase-a). you don't need someone else's framework, with their embedded values, to point you at what's important about your game, you already know.</p>

        <p>p.p.p.s. we're all certified agile coaches now.</p>

        <p>i'm going to try and wear a lightly yellowed hat, at least for the purposes of rituals we've already attempted but haven't maintained.</p>

        <p>it feels like d has shouldered a lot of this burden, and id like to relieve some of that. that being said, this decision is also absolutely self-motivated. i think our relative lack of structure is causing me a ton of anxiety. while the corresponding lack of top-down pressure on this project has been nice, and i don't want to exert any such pressure on others, i think i need to exert a little on myself for accountability purposes.</p>

        <p>yesterday, i started thinking about <span class="Problem">The Problem</span> again. if we're still attempting to solve it (are we?), then perhaps we should try to translate the same attitude of nonjudgemental openness-to-modification that we apply to "the game" to "the process" (insofar as we are successful at that in any domain). maybe we already do. maybe it's simply unarticulated. it feels like the sort of thing worth articulating, reaffirming.</p>

        <p>speaking of which, the desire "to re-establish, constantly, whenever we feel it necessary" our "intention of playing well together" feels like it fell by the wayside, a little anyways. wow how insanely hard that last predicate, "whenever we feel it necessary" is to navigate. is it possible to ritualize this without hollowing it out, without its affirmative qualities evaporating? honestly no idea.</p>

        <p>all things considered, openness-to-modification does seem a degree or two harder, more sensitive when we're modifying process as opposed to artifact. it impacts more people, more directly (though, does it?), at least in terms of the face time consumed (though, does it?). mythical meat months. i think such changes may need to be constantly packaged with reaffirmations of an opennes-to-unrolling them, for a while anyways.</p>

        <p>p.s. in a recent meeting and a moment of aphasiac foot-in-mouth i referred to my own blog-writing as "truth-telling", which jfc is an insane person thing to say. i am so sorry, yuck. all i really wanted to say was that as a player, i would personally appreciate an authentic window into the creators' minds. i think that window is nice, generally, though definitely shouldn't be obligatory.</p>

        <p>p.p.s. thinking about a way to syndicate/index blogposts, grab a feed of what's changed. i sort of anticipated this happening as the semester wore on, and i know i am now struggling to notice and read new posts when they're added. maybe a build-time tool that constructs an index page, maybe there's some html-spec tech that address this. maybe a discord bot?</p>

        <p>p.p.p.s. have some mostly unexplored thoughts rolling around my head about against interpretation. its criticisms, by my reading anyways, were trained mostly on secondary (what is this) interpreters. i feel like the interpretive mode also runs hot at creation time, interpretation often prefiguring the creation itself. i personally don't love it. she talks about authorial interpretation a bit, but does anyone recall specific passages in the text that speak to this?</p>

        <aside>going to start tagging anything i add to this site with a unix timestamp (e.g. <code>&lt;article timestamp="1612893390"&gt;</code>) s/t maybe a program could deconstruct/linearize/analyze it in the future.</aside>

        <p>while i need to finish my free-salad-like, there are some thoughts that i've been tossing around in my head that i need to jot down here. on our site of reflection.</p>

        <p>i've been procrastinating work on my game. i think it's a funny comic, i have a few ideas for things i could make, but i'm not particularly inspried to make them. it reminds of my personal gripes with book clubs. even in the unlikely event that everyone agrees on a book, scheduling is a hard, different people feel more strongly about the book than others, some want to read faster than others are able to commit to. for me, reading successfully means reading the book i'm most interested in at any given moment, regardless of whether or not other people want to read it.</p>

        <p>much of our group conversation, and at least one version of creative challenge, concerns <span class="Problem">The Problem</span>. the tension between preserving individual creative voices and creating something together. in the pursuit of creating a Shared Thing, a single game, individual voices are averaged out into a homogenous mean. this has happened. this does happen. this will happen again.</p>

        <p>in spite of this fact, i derive a lot of joy from working with others, often (but not necessarily) on the Single Shared Thing. from growing my own ideas and seeing them incorporated into an aggregate beyond my personal comprehension or individual capacity for creation. from the unburdening that accompanies the brilliant, insightful contributions of my collaborators unshackling me from my own bad ideas. of repeatedly failing to, but eventually finding the rhythm that gives birth to such moments. i think i like working on the Shared Thing <em>because</em> of the risk of the homogenous mean and the thrill of figuring out how to evade it.</p>

        <p>during one of our conversations, darwin pointed out that we may be lifting <span class="Problem">The Problem</span> up from the level of "game" to the level of "process". i think this is right. however, increasingly i feel like it only describes half of what's happening. even as we attempt to design this process, as we discard tradtitional modes that have silenced our individual voices, i feel my own voice being squelched. probably no surprise that we have not found immediate success; we shed a member before the project even started.</p>

        <p>i'm not sure that my squelched feelings have anything to do with what we make or with how we make it. i don't even think having those feelings is a <em style="color: #D15A50;">bad thing</em>; it's necessary. my intution is that <span class="Problem">The Problem</span> transcends levels, that it can't be lifted. it is an intrinsic feature of working with others on anything, of navigating the inevitable litany of feelings, preferences, behaviors, etc. necessary to learn to trust and understand a new person or group of people. we are right now in the weeds of learning to work together, of understanding our collaborators' creative voices. we are learning how to support each other's expressions rather than carving out space for our own.</p>

        <p>being in the weeds is beautiful. i think through the unreplicable process of learning to support and lift up the creative voices of the individuals that we are working with, we can avoid the homogoneous mean. i think we can avoid it thusly if we're making a Single Shared Thing or if we're making fifty.</p>

        <p>this is a thought i have "known" (if such a thing is knowable) for some time. amongst a scattering of other points in time, i think i've known it most clearly after reading the shockingly good <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781576753323">One from Many</a> by Dee Hock and the embarassingly named <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780321278654">Extreme Programming Explained</a> by Kent Beck and Cynthia Andres. there is no process, there is only people. no practices, just principles. it has recently re-crystalled for me while reading The Well-Played Game. "to play well" requires that we recognize that "the energy resides not in the game but in playing with people", is "to create well" any different?</p>
