hi i'm fran welcome to my blog where i will be talking about my experience with our collective collage poem game which is currently a work in progress.
i hope that this will be a documentation of our semester-long process and also a helpful tool for personal and collective reflection later on.

<h3>3/4</h3>
<p> going to try again. i was just messing around and got an idea to make it so that you can walk out of the alidator game into the parent computer. not sure if this is possible, but i think i'll learn something</p>
<p>if this works, i think i want to make it so that you can then walk around the computer and enter the forest icon, which is actually cyberspace. but yeah we'll see if this even works </p>
<p> i've run into a bug "Event is not a constructor". sad. I'm going to comment out my code for now, i have gamer studies in a few minutes </p>
<h3>3/3 - lets just try to do something</h3>
<p>once again it is tuesday night and i haven't done shit this week. i told myself that i would only work on this project when i wanted to but it just keeps getting pushed around by other responsiblities so i never carve out time. i guess i'll carve some time out of my sleep now. cool cool cool</p>
<p>maybe if it wasn't the third week in a row that i didn't do anything, i'd just go to sleep. but i don't like feeling like i'm not participating.</p>
<p>anyway: the idea is to render a part of the narrative that jenny wrote into an interactive thing. hopefully i can experiment with a window concept or some other concept we've talked about. i'll openjen's narrative and the miro</p>
<p>i jus saw that mut is using domino for their notes that's v cool</p>
<p> ok so jenny's narrative great</p>
<p> yeah not really sure how we're going to do this</p>
<p> first we need a nother icon in the computer to enter cyberspace. or maybe you put your hand on it or something </p>
<p> i dont have to do all of cyberspace. i'll give myself like an hour to try to get something</p>
<p> o shit darwin's doing one of those custom html tags the mad lad</p>
<p>ok so the question is -> I want the player to feel like they're moving through to another space. what would be cool hough is if they... felt like they could still "step away" from the computer?? hmmm</p>
<p> yeah yeah this icon is <i>different</i> from the other icons because clicking on this will make you actually enter a new space. lets test out that window ontology research</p>
<p> i should have like a cool transition. and the music should change too. but i'm not gonna do that tn hell no</p>
<p> no wait you know what, i know what i'm gonna do<p>
<p> hm iframes are iframes<p>
<p> i'm not gonna get the effect i wanted. just gonna go to sleep. this was fun though i'm excited to get back on it some other day<p>
<h3> 3/1 - some reflections on the third week </h3>
<p>i didn't really do much work this week. again.</p>
<p>we're moving towards having a more intentional narrative for our game. we spent a lot of time this week talking about what that means. Jenny wrote a story outline which is super exciting. its weird, in the past i've been frustrated about having to be the guy that implements other people's ideas, but now i'm excited to interpret jenny's writing into something.</p>
<p>but yeah i haven't had time/motivation to work on this at all. i had the pico 8 workshop that took up a lot of time to prep for... this is the second week in a row where i haven't really "practiced" in the art school sense of practice. im sad i love to make things. maybe this week will be better</p>
<p>either way, we also started a discord server this week for our group. by "we", i mean mut. its really cool. its just nice to see what my colleagues are into at any given point. i want to get into the habit of reaching for that group when i want to waste time, instead of like instagram or twitter. not only are the links that we share more aligned with what im interested in, its also more meaningful that its from people that i know and like. </p>
<h3> 2/20 - some reflections on the second week </h3>
<p>this week, we had a <i>gather</i> phase where we put our games together. what it means to <i>put our games together</i>, in more specific terms, was the subject of our conversations and experiements. i say "our", but i didn't do much work this week. I participated in our discussions and one time where we did a group code for something, but i didn't work any experiments on my own. I was catching up on other work this week, and that sapped all my energy.</p>
<p>but my colleagues have produced some interesting prototypes for different ways that our games can interact with eachother. they're pretty cool in their own rights, and have been really helpful as references for our conversations this week on how we want to take this <i>gathering</i> idea further.</p>
<p>we're still in a vague conceptual land when talking about how we're going to put things together, although the end of this week we started moving towards more concrete proofs-of-concept. hopefully this week i can do/participate in one of these experiments</p>
<h3> 2/14 - some reflections on the first week </h3>
<p>first, i'll talk about our "output", and then i'll reflect on how it felt</p>
<p>i'm pretty pleased by the artifacts that we've created this week. we all somehow managed to find time and energy to make one game each. and then on friday we <a href="gatherings/iframes.html">put them together.</a> the result is pretty amazing. each game shows the interests and talent of the individual that made it. knowing my colleagues, I could tell you who made each one just by playing them. (the one that is the most surprising to me is Ty's. it's a wonderful poem-game, and i would say his poem-blogpost is a part of the piece too. I think it's just a side of Ty that i didn't know. ah, humans.) a variety of tools are used. I think me and Ty are the only ones who used the "same tool" (if you could call vanilla js/html a tool).</p>
<p>as for my game personally, i'm proud of what i've made. it's a pretty pared down expression of the idea that i was going for, it relates to the inspiring image somewhat, and the central feature of it, the audio leak, is a happy accident where i let the material that i was working with (javascript/html) inform the design</p>
<p>collectively, they're all interesting and great games in of themselves, and just putting them together "naively" in draggable iframes (using d's drag code!) works for making an interactive c0llage. you can sort of click into a game, play it for a bit... wander over to another game... get annoyued by the drip sound and scramble to stop it... if you know the reference image, you can see the connection, and if you don't that's okay too. the c0llage creates something meaningful</p>
<p>so i guess that's it. we did it. we found a good process. we're done for the semester</p>
<p>the process felt meaningful and enjoyable to me too. i enjoyed being able to have my little corner of the website where i could do what i wanted without having to make creative compromises. </p>
<p>i liked checking in to the website/github repo and seeing what people were working on.</p>
<p>i like haunting. it felt wrong and fun and playful, and a way to interact with my colleague's work. Ty said he liked the haunting so that's good... i wasn't sure if it would be annoying. i tried not to do too much. and i wonder if i myself was haunted, if i would take it so well...</p>
<p>i find myself getting pretty invested/energized by this project. i think the dark side to that is that it's making me somewhat anxious about wanting to make sure things keep "going well." i think i need to chill somewhat. it's just strange and suspicious how well this is going</p>
<p>one thing that is worth mentioning is that i had a pretty anomolous week last week in terms of my personal life. i don't want to get too into it, but i'm wondering how much of my "productivity" and enjoyment last week was due to factors outside of our process, like i had more time and energy in some ways. a couple people mentioned that they didn't feel motivated to for ex. do a haunt, or work on their game more/earlier. and the ibvious implication is that they wish they <i>had</i> felt motivated to put in more work... and yeah i'm also not sure what the solution to that is. how much of it has to do with <i>the process</i> and how much of it is just that Game Design I took up approximately 8092348098 hours of our time last week, and left us with no energy to do anything else? (i mostly shirked my responsibilities to my Game Design I group last week!!). i could say more about how i think this program overworks us to everyone's detriment, but i won't</p>
<p>along the same lines, i'm sensing that some of my colleagues are struggling with the more technical side of things. i think that it might be a good idea to try to listen more to my colleagues needs, and try to help them with those. during our meeting on friday, jenny was sad that she couldn't get her LOVE game to run. while we were talking, darwin figured it out. he just sort of went ahead and did it. i think that was a really cool and important moment </p>
<h3> 2/10 </h3>
<div class="ghost">
<p>i am thiking ghost thoughts</p>
<p>it is easier to haunt someone when their process/tools are more open/apparent/accessible. ty was pretty easy to haunt bc his game is raw html/js and i did that for my game so i could grok his version more easily. d is doing a twine game, so i guess she's using Twine lol. the only thing i have is the exported html. should i try to reverse it somehow.... my head hurts </p>
<p> o i wonder if i can import it into twine. god i hope this works</p>
<p> oh my fucking god yes</p>
<p> before i ruin this lovely walking simulator, i'll do something helpful????</p>
<p> oh god twine. i have to figure out what syntax d is using</p>
<p> I JUST WANT TO KNOW THE FUCKING FOMRAT</p>
<p> maybe it doesnt matter maybe im dumb</p>
<p> no it DOES matter </p>
<p> sugarcube is the one she's using i think </p>

<p> when you first open this up, it shows $lastlocation in plaintext without doing the "right" thing of substituting it with the number etc. etc. you get it. i was going to "fix" it but i actually like it... it's like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocytic_nevus">beauty mark</a>.it points to something gross and complicated that is happening beneath the surface. its mostly working and coming together to form this cohesive, delicately-balanced whole. there are milions of little microbes on your face and there is code that makes this twine game work </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150508-these-mites-live-on-your-face">"Scientists have known that humans carry face mites for a long time"</a>. um when were you going to tell us, <i>Scientists?</i></p>
<img src="img/demodex.jpeg">
<p>look at this guy</p>
<p>also after thinking about it for 2 seconds, this is probably just debug text that d is going ot get rid for the final thing anyway</p>
<p>ok lets do a haunt so i can go to sleep</p>
<p>when ur haunting it's important to not change any more than u need to</p>
<p>i love what d has done</p>
<p>heheheheheheheheheheheheehehehehehehehehe</p>
<p>lol i'm gonna fuck up d's beautiful story web</p>
<p>o boy i sure hope i didn't fuck this all up for d</p>
<p>this whole thing has only made my headache worse</p>
</div>



<h3> 2/9 </h3>
<p>i'm doing the wrong with with the audio, and so instead of playing the drip sound once, it just keeps playing it over and over again. also i think i'm not cleaning up the drop objects when they're done? i kind of like how it creats this audio leak and memory leak though. now we're making art</p>
<p> also this gives me an idea for how to haunt</p>
<p> collecting the drops with the bucket should still stop or stimmie the leak somehow. so i should still figure out how to play the audio properly then</p>

<p> im pretty satisfied with where it is now. maybe i want to represent the puddle with an image... and maybe the floor too?? and most importantly, change the bucket to a cup and let you drink it. idk if i'll have time though. i'd rather try to do some haunting </p>
<p>i renamed it "free juice" but i'm wondering if i should change it back to "leak". "free juice" ties it to the inspiring image free salad, and would help with haveing more cohesion among our games. but it's a little confusing when looking at the game in a vaccuum... "leak" does a lot more conceptual work as a title</p>

<h3> 2/8 </h3>

<p> the leak starts small but grows over time </p>
<p> the drip from the leak varies in intensity/frequency. sometimes its like drip...drip...drip... soemtimes its like ddripdripdripdripdrip</p>
<p> without a bucket, the water will just pool on the ground (eventually cause a second leak??)</p>
<p> the water is brown and gunky </p>
<p> taste still unknown </p>
<p> there should be leaves in the bucket</p>
<br>
<p>d has a pretty nifty way of dragging elements around so i think that's what i'll start with<p>
<p>o and ty has a pretty nice game framework....</p>
<p>ok the next thing is to ake a drawSprite func that is basically just style.left = x etc. and keep the x and y in our own objects</p>
<p>lol it drips. the sound is broken but in a good way</p>

<h3> 2/6 free salad </h3>

<p>
we decided on our <a href="collective-processes.html">process for the week</a> and now we're gonna make some games
</p>


<p>
this comic makes me weak. it's very good. the first thing i thought of was a leak that i had in my apartment the past week.
</p>
<img src="img/leak-small.jpg">
<video controls> 
    <source src="img/leak-vid.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<img src="img/leak-big.jpg">
<img src="ima/bucket.jpg">
<p>
some questions that naturally arose in me were "where did this pen come from?" and "i wonder what this water tastes like"
</p>
<p>
i've been wanting to make a game about something boring or mundane. like mumblecore but videogames. or as Ty poetically put it "an exceedingly beautiful corner." i kind of just want to simulate a leak in your ceiling
</p>
<p>
tools-wise, i think i want to try to do this with html and javascript and without using the html5 canvas. i've been pretty jazzed on making games for the web for the past year or so. it pains me that games made with Unity are so heavy and make my laptop hot. we were talking about tools and at one point someone joked "yeah we should write our own 2d game engine for the web" and the joke is that that would really dumb bc who has the time for that and i laughed bc yeah, we've all been there lol. unless...
</p>
<p>
i kind of want to try to do something with a similar materiality to <a href="http://walky.space">walky.space</a>. most web games/interactive arts use the HTML5 canvas, but walky does not. it's just moving divs around. this sort of material is really cool to me. the thing is that walky uses React, and i wonder why. i don't want to use React, it feels like too much...
</p>
<p>
hopefully this idea isn't too much work to pull off. i'd like to have something to show earlier in the week so that it can get haunted and so that i have time to do some haunting.
</p>

<h3> 2/5 - in which we start to do the damn thing</h3>
<p>
today we're going to start making our game(s) which i'm excited about. i already have a vague idea of where i want to go with my piece :) but first i'll reflect a little on what we've done so far.
</p>

<p>
i just read over darwin's 'wednesday febuary 3' blog entry and the excquisite corpse documentation by mut. thank god someone's already documented the details of our process thank youuuuuuuuu
</p>

<p>
darwin articulated really well some feelings that i share. i feel similarly about George leaving... i wonder if we could've done something differently
</p>
<p>
and i would say my motivations for <i>doing what we're doing</i> are similar. after a few experiences of collaborating with people and making things on my own, i feel pretty cynical about working on something expressive/creative with others. part of this is that i feel like i like the things that i make by myself more than those that i make with others, and some of my favorite work is also made by one author (i'll add cecile richard, molleindustria. also um.... most books/stories/poems??)
</p>

<p>
and i'll more explicitly focus on another aspect which is how the process itself feels. to me there's two parts to it, there's the question of  1) "is the art object(s) that we produce something we are happy with/proud of?" and 2) "is the process enjoyable/fruitful/feels good?" and  im a greedy bitch and i want both.
</p>
<p>
this experiment rests on the assumption that it's worth it to try to design a formal process of making things together. but already we've come upon some instances where its less about <i>the process</i> and more about... paying attention and being sensitive and communicating with each other? so maybe it's just important that we have a mutual understanding or like-minded or similar values, in which case whatever process we end up with is just window-dressing anyway? the truth is probably somewhere in the middle. how important is having a clever process, and how much is it all the little social, improvisational details of working with each other? in any case, i've been thinking a lot about how to communicate with my group, including indirectly through these blogposts (devil emoji)
</p>
<p>
speaking of, it's interesting that darwin was worried he brought the energy down in one of   group meetings. i think his calm is lovely and makes space for earnest conversation. i find myself getting anxious and usually my move is to cut the try to cut the tension with a usually bad joke but i think sometimes trying to bring the mood up gets in the way of teasing out/working through difficult thoughts
</p>
<p>
i've been feeling tired after our conversations and sessions. zooming for more than an hour is for masochists. but also i think what we've been doing/talking about is tiring work. exquusite corpse is fun but requires a lot of concentration. and so do the type of conversations we've been having. we've been talking a lot about reference work, especially past experiments that bear resemblance to ours (which i still have to play: utopias, circle0, experiment 12, jrpgsystems ...). it's all work. even writing this blogpost is now taking me probably too long. jesus it's 5pm already what the fuck i need to actually make the <i>a game</i>. i'm happy we're doing all this, i think its valuable, especially in the beginning. but goddamn, there's only so much time in a day and so much energy in my animal body.
</p>
<p>
this is obviously reminding me of sfpc, which is weird. there's a lot of differences. but this sort of earnest collective spirit, and emphasis on documentation and thinking about process... i remember working on my first blogpost about the vera hw. i think i only ended up doing like 1 and a half posts for the entire time i was there though hahah. so idk. we'll seeeeeeee
</p>
