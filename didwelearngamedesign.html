    List of things we learned so far:
    <ul>
      <li>
        that randomly placed links will be read with intentionality. And that people are more likely to take the more
        common path first (from forest 1)
      </li>
      <li>
        that people don't necessarily click links
      </li>
      <li>
        that, perhaps because people expect videogames to have ambiguous & deep systems, players can become overwhelmed
        when they aren't clued into a system (even & especially when there is none to speak of). think of the confusion
        & disappointment gamers had with early walking sims
      </li>
      <li>
        that the object "game" & the object "website" are different & call for different objects. further, the object
        "game" is dominant over the object "website," so when a game-like object is embedded in a website, it's what
        defines the experience for people
        <ul>
          <li>
            that there is a big tension in the differentiation of the forest website and the forest adventure game, and
            that we constantly navigate in such inbetweeness. People can't forget it's a website, but people can't not
            think of it as a game. But as per above comment, it very easily collapses to the 'game' object.
          </li>
          <li>
            That as a game designer (and big non-diegetic interface hater), I assumed that it would be good to remove a
            spatial UI arrow and replace it with invisible colliders with a more traditional game accepted interface
            (cursors). However videogame and website conventions generate a new layer of interface types, ones that even
            if non-diegetic in a traditional way, are diegetic within the expectations of a videogame. Hand things
            pointing directions are diegetic for myst, buttons and clickable images are diegetic for the internet.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        that it takes a certain kind of social engineering in order to get designer-players to consider the embeddedness
        of an embedded game (i.e., consider the context & the material of the game, not just the kind of game itself).
        this is the opposite challenge from what gallery artists who make interactive pieces experience. in their case,
        the context of a gallery space is so laden with social & aesthetic expectations that it's incredibly hard to get
        viewers to physically interact with a piece
      </li>
      <li>
        that given a certain treshold of bugginess and players acceptance of it, any bug can be read as intentional and
        ascribed interesting meaning into. This makes it extremely hard and interesting to 'follow the fun' or 'follow
        the meaning', but also at the same time changed the usual approach of seeing bugs as mostly negative aspects.
        Bugs are bugs only as long as someone really wants it fixed.
      </li>
    </ul>
