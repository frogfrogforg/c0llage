    List of things we learned so far:
    <ul>
      <li>
        that randomly placed links will be read with intentionality. And that people are more likely to take the more
        common path first (from forest 1)
      </li>
      <li>
        that people don't necessarily click links
      </li>
      <li>
        that, perhaps because people expect videogames to have ambiguous & deep systems, players can become overwhelmed when they aren't clued into a system (even & especially when there is none to speak of). think of the confusion & disappointment gamers had with early walking sims
      </li>
      <li>
        that the object "game" & the object "website" are different & call for different objects. further, the object "game" is dominant over the object "website," so when a game-like object is embedded in a website, it's what defines the experience for people
      </li>
      <li>
        that it takes a certain kind of social engineering in order to get designer-players to consider the embeddedness of an embedded game (i.e., consider the context & the material of the game, not just the kind of game itself). this is the opposite challenge from what gallery artists who make interactive pieces experience. in their case, the context of a gallery space is so laden with social & aesthetic expectations that it's incredibly hard to get viewers to physically interact with a piece
      </li>
    </ul>
