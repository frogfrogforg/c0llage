      I don't understand why greek myths keep showing up in my life. Apparently 2020 was the year of <a target="_blank"
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i91seRAhb60"> Sisyphus</a> (I might've heard that name 90% of the
      total ammount of times in my life just last year). Then there's <a target="_blank" href="../d/sappho.html">d</a>,
      which also keeps bringing these up, and like busts and the like. And then I just read this amazing graphic novel,
      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterios_Polyp"> Asterios Polyp </a>, which had a bunch of
      greek
      philosophical and mythological stuff. Particularly the myth of Orpheus (an interesting aside is that I only
      recognized
      that my web search to figure out what myth it was was "don't look back myth" , thinking about <a target="_blank"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_Look_Back_(video_game)"> terry cavanaghs game</a>)

      It's funny to think that these myths exist to this day and the way we get in touch with them is so particular.
      Like
      I
      think I only really know this stuff because of like Hercules, but it actually is everywhere and we still learn it
      in
      a
      very intereting folkish way? I keep wondering if it's a thing that belongs to me, or what kind of mythology is
      actually one that I had more intensely as a kid.
