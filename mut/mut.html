  <p>
    I might write some thoughts in portuguese sometimes, I might also try to think something about translation and about
    the
    web being in english. And I'll see if I can find any automated solution to easily translate some stuff.

  <p id="i-decided-to-create-a-blog-actually">
    I wasn't sure if I wanted to create my own page until now, but reading everyone else I realized it seems actually
    cool (and a pretty nice way to put our ideas out and try connecting them with the other ideas people seem to be
    having)
  </p>
  <div id="where-i-talk-a-bit-about-free-salad">
    <p>
      Haven't done much work (other than trying to come up with ideas) for my free salad game yet. I think I kind of
      connect a little to what ty is mentioning in his own page about this game. I don't totally vibe with the theme.
      But
      in the other hand I hardly ever really vibe with a theme. Again a parallel to ty, I pretty much vibe with whatever
      I
      am actually vibing at the moment. I also really like how silly it is, and giving a bit more credit, it's a more
      interesting theme than like 90% of gamejams I can think of (<a
        href="https://itch.io/jam/design-from-sound-jam">this being a counter example</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
      And even more so, I really like collaboration, and sometimes I feel that I am some sort of parasite, where I need
      to have someone else's creative juice flowing in order to maximize my own stuff. Working on this kind of solo kind
      of group project seems to be a pretty cool challenge for myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been seeing other people's stuff and kept feeling I wanted to like mess around with everything instead of
      making my own stuff. Hard to think that I don't mind being invisible in the final thing as long as I personally
      see I had influence on it? Hopefully in the future I'll be more on the haunting side than on the creating side.
    </p>
    <p>
      However I did have thoughts about free salad. And instead of implementing any of them I decided to start just
      writing this blog entry and putting them out here. The first thing that came to mind was the <a
        href="https://www.wikipedia.com/en/Prometheus">
        myth of prometheus</a>, more specifically because I didn't think about the myth itself, but about <a
        target="_blank" href="https://www.pippinbarr.com/2011/12/30/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment/">this game by
        pippin barr</a>
      (which has been a developer that's been on my mind a lot). <a href="./greek-myths.html"> I've been thinking about
        greek myths and decided to create a whole page for that</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did end up making
    <h3><button onclick="showBitsyGame()">a bitsy thing </button></h3> with <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.pippinbarr.com/games/2019/07/17/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-bitsy-demake.html"></a>pippin
    barrs bitsy version of the greek punishment thing. Creative Commons is a beauty.

      <iframe src="./salada-gratuita.html" title="Salada Prometida"></iframe>

      Might write a bit more later on how hard is bitsy and how beautiful the default character actually is.
