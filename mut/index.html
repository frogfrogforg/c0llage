  <p>
    I might write some thoughts in portuguese sometimes, I might also try to think something about translation and about
    the
    web being in english. And I'll see if I can find any automated solution to easily translate some stuff.

      2021.02.22.2 - Some html experimentation
    </h2>
    <p>
      I found out the other than from an Everest Pipkin tweet I can't find anymore that there is a builtin folding feature in html, it's called <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_details.asp">&ltdetails&gt</a>. I think it will work nice with conjuntion with importing from dynalist.
      <details>
        <summary>This is the summary, inside a details tag</summary>
        <details>
          <summary>You can nest summaries, which is pretty cool</summary>
          <details>
            <summary> Sadly the summary has the little arrow on the side regardless of having content or not, but I think its fine</summary>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>
              I can even have multiple things, making it highly nested.</details>
            </summary>
            <details>
              <summary>It is a bit confusing</summary>
              <details>
                <summary>But I'll practice here...</summary>
                <details>
                  <summary>And children</summary>
                  <details>
                    <summary>And goind very deep</summary>
                    <details>
                      <summary>deeper</summary>
                      <p id="deeper">What happens if I link to one of these</p>
                    </details>
                    <details>
                      <summary>and deeper</summary>
                    </details>
                  </details>
                </details>

              <details>
                <summary>creating siblings</summary>
              </details>
            </details>
        </details> 
        <p>
          can I <a href="#deeper">link </a> to something very deep? What happens?
        </p>
        <details>
          <summary> Do you think this worked on my first try?</summary>
          <p>lets see...</p>
          <p>All the nested things worked really nice. If feels way less deep on the page than it feels doing it here on the html tags</p>
          <details>
          <summary>Sadly the linking thing doesn't work as I intended it (opening all the nested stuff), but I guess that was asking too much, and it might not be a very hard js to write.</summary>
          <p> Update: it works and is kind of interesting. Not completely ideal yet, but nice.</p>
          </details>
          <p>Thats what I'm doing now</p>

      2021.02.22.1 - More thoughts on thoughts
    </h2>

    <p> After using
      <a href="./mutthoughts.html">
        domino
      </a> for a while, I realised (I hate this word, is it with z or with s??? discord keeps correcting me to use s)
      that it is still not ideal for a couple of reasons:
    <ul>
      <li id="other-part">
        the size of each block is not very big to contain big thoughts, so I have to force myself to do chunks, which
        makes me think too much while writing
      </li>
      <li>
        Even if a 2d grid is way more free than like this 1d html document, there is a slight offset and rigidity that
        makes it hard to actually go to places I want to.
        <ul>
          <li>
            there's definitely the possibility to mod it, breaking the grid and creating bezier arrows between things
            that might make it really nice for my personal use
          </li>
          <li>
            probably for someone more organized it might work better as well.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      in the end of the day, dynalist is my tool of choice, which unfortunately is not open source. I think someday I
      might find someone that uses org mode to show me how they do it and if it gives the same functionality. A wyiwyg
      thing that has an infinitely nested tree-like structure really goes really well with how I think, especially with
      the possibility of creating <a href="#other-part"> links </a> to other parts of the structure. That and the
      ability to fold and focus on specific regions is so good. I have to see the export possibilities of dynalist.

      I am having a hard time keeping up with this blog, so I decided to test a new tool, let's see if it works. Blog
      continues <a href="./mutthoughts.html">

    <p id="i-decided-to-create-a-blog-actually">
      I wasn't sure if I wanted to create my own page until now, but reading everyone else I realized it seems actually
      cool (and a pretty nice way to put our ideas out and try connecting them with the other ideas people seem to be
      having)
    </p>
    <div id="where-i-talk-a-bit-about-free-salad">
      <p>
        Haven't done much work (other than trying to come up with ideas) for my free salad game yet. I think I kind of
        connect a little to what ty is mentioning in his own page about this game. I don't totally vibe with the theme.
        But
        in the other hand I hardly ever really vibe with a theme. Again a parallel to ty, I pretty much vibe with
        whatever
        I
        am actually vibing at the moment. I also really like how silly it is, and giving a bit more credit, it's a more
        interesting theme than like 90% of gamejams I can think of (<a
          href="https://itch.io/jam/design-from-sound-jam">this being a counter example</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        And even more so, I really like collaboration, and sometimes I feel that I am some sort of parasite, where I
        need
        to have someone else's creative juice flowing in order to maximize my own stuff. Working on this kind of solo
        kind
        of group project seems to be a pretty cool challenge for myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been seeing other people's stuff and kept feeling I wanted to like mess around with everything instead of
        making my own stuff. Hard to think that I don't mind being invisible in the final thing as long as I personally
        see I had influence on it? Hopefully in the future I'll be more on the haunting side than on the creating side.
      </p>
      <p>
        However I did have thoughts about free salad. And instead of implementing any of them I decided to start just
        writing this blog entry and putting them out here. The first thing that came to mind was the <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus">
          myth of prometheus</a>, more specifically because I didn't think about the myth itself, but about <a
          target="_blank" href="https://www.pippinbarr.com/2011/12/30/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment/">this game by
          pippin barr</a>
        (which has been a developer that's been on my mind a lot). <a href="./greek-myths.html"> I've been thinking
          about
          greek myths and decided to create a whole page for that</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did end up making
        <button onclick="showBitsyGame()">a bitsy thing </button></h3>
      </p>
      <div id="salada-gratuita" class="nope">
        <iframe src="./salada-gratuita.html" title="Salada Prometida"></iframe>
      </div>
      <p>
        with <a target="_blank"
          href="https://www.pippinbarr.com/games/2019/07/17/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-bitsy-demake.html">pippin
          barrs bitsy version of the greek punishment thing</a>. Creative Commons is a beauty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Might write a bit more later on how hard is bitsy and how beautiful the default character actually is.
