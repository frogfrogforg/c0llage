<p style="font-weight:bold;">Forest:</p>
<p>
 <br>
You step into the forest. There are two paths
  </p>
  <p>
→ You walk forward
      </p>
  <p>
    There is a frog
      </p>
  <p>
    → you click on their computer
      </p>
  <p>
        “How rude, they’re using the computer”
      </p>
  <p>
    → you walk left
      </p>
  <p>
→ You walk left
      </p>
  <p>
    You see another computer
      </p>
  <p>
    → Click on it
      </p>
  <p>
        You’re now in <p style="font-weight:bold;">cyberspace</p>
</p>

<p>
<br><br><br><br>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">Cyberspace:</p>
  <br><br>
  </p>
  <p>
You’re in a forest, and there is a sign in gibberish before you.
      </p>
  <p>
If you follow the sign, you see a long hallway of trees
      </p>
  <p>
Along the sides of this tree hallway, there’s rows upon rows of computers as far as your eye can see
      </p>
  <p>
This is…….. A net cafe for little forest animals…. It’s called……. Cyberspace
      </p>
  <p>
If you look closely at any of these computers, there’s a little animal at each one.
      </p>
  <p>
Some of them are frogs, or toads, or squirrels, and there’s one swan wearing sunglasses
      </p>
  <p>
If you ask the swan what he’s doing there he says “You just got powned newb(beware flashing lights)”
      </p>
  <p>
If you look at any of the other animals computers, they’re playing various games, or reading really sick blogs
      </p>
  <p>
These animals seem like hardcore gamers, they intimidate you
      </p>
  <p>
 If you are done spending time with these animals, you can keep walking along the hallway
      </p>
  <p>
At the end of the hallway is the entrance to the <p style="font-weight:bold;">Cosmodrome</p>
      </p>
  <p>

<br><br><br><br>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">Cosmodrome:</p>
      </p>
  <br>
  <p>
The entrance to the Cosmodrome is made of a large stone that juts towards the sky.
      </p>
  <p>
The stone is full of doors, each one leading to an odd room. There is one door, though, that leads to another hallway.
      </p>
  <p>
The hallway is studded with stars, each floating, glowing, and moving in no apparent pattern. 
      </p>
  <p>
At the end of the hall is a circular room topped with a glass dome. A panel in this dome opens to allow a telescope through. Along the walls are six doors, each with a familiar name written on it. 
  </p>
  <p>
If you look below the telescope, you can see a panel with a whoooole buncha buttons, each one a different color and size than its compatriots. There’s a small screen in the center of the panel. Above that screen is a sign that says “Star Crafting.”
  </p>
  <p>
If you tap on the screen, an fmv video fades in, and someone says “What’s up gamers, I’m d.”
