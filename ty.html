      <aside>going to start tagging anything i add to this site with a unix timestamp (e.g. <code>&lt;article timestamp="1612893390"&gt;</code>) s/t maybe a program could deconstruct/linearize/analyze it in the future.</aside>
      <p>while i need to finish my free-salad-like, there are some thoughts that i've been tossing around in my head that i need to jot down here. on our site of reflection.<p>
      <p>i've been procrastinating work on my game. i think it's a funny comic, i have a few ideas for things i could make, but i'm not particularly inspried to make them. it reminds of my personal gripes with book clubs. even in the unlikely event that everyone agrees on a book, scheduling is a hard, different people feel more strongly about the book than others, some want to read faster than others are able to commit to. for me, reading successfully means reading the book i'm most interested in at any given moment, regardless of whether or not other people want to read it.</p>
      <p>much of our group conversation, and at least one version of creative challenge, concerns The Problem. the tension between preserving individual creative voices and creating something together. in the pursuit of creating a Shared Thing, a single game, individual voices are averaged out into a homogenous mean. this has happened. this does happen. this will happen again.</p>
      <p>in spite of this fact, i derive a lot of joy from working with others, often (but not necessarily) on the Single Shared Thing. from growing my own ideas and seeing them incorporated into an aggregate beyond my personal comprehension or individual capacity for creation. from the unburdening that accompanies the brilliant, insightful contributions of my collaborators unshackling me from my own bad ideas. of repeatedly failing to, but eventually finding the rhythm that gives birth to such moments. i think i like working on the Shared Thing <em>because</em> of the risk of the homogenous mean and the thrill of figuring out how to evade it.</p>
      <p>during one of our conversations, darwin pointed out that we may be lifting The Problem up from the level of "game" to the level of "process". i think this is right. however, increasingly i feel like it only describes half of what's happening. even as we attempt to design this process, as we discard tradtitional modes that have silenced our individual voices, i feel my own voice being squelched. probably no surprise that we have not found immediate success; we shed a member before the project even started.</p>
      <p>i'm not sure that my squelched feelings have anything to do with what we make or with how we make it. i don't even think having those feelings is a <em style="color: firebrick;">bad thing</em>; it's necessary. my intution is that The Problem transcends levels, that it can't be lifted. it is an intrinsic feature of working with others on anything, of navigating the inevitable litany of feelings, preferences, behaviors, etc. necessary to learn to trust and understand a new person or group of people. we are right now in the weeds of learning to work together, of understanding our collaborators' creative voices. we are learning how to support each other's expressions rather than carving out space for our own.</p>
      <p>being in the weeds is beautiful. i think through the unreplicable process of learning to support and lift up the creative voices of the individuals that we are working with, we can avoid the homogoneous mean. i think we can avoid it thusly if we're making a Single Shared Thing or if we're making fifty.</p>
      <p>this is a thought i have "known" (if such a thing is knowable) for some time. amongst a scattering of other points in time, i think i've known it most clearly after reading the shockingly good <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781576753323">One from Many</a> by Dee Hock and the embarassingly named <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780321278654">Extreme Programming Explained</a> by Kent Beck and Cynthia Andres. there is no process, there is only people. no practices, just principles. it has recently re-crystalled for me while reading The Well-Played Game. "to play well" requires that we recognize that "the energy resides not in the game but in playing with people", is "to create well" any different?</p>
