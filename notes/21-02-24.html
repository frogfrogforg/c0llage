<p data-speaker="ghost">i want u 2 let me in</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">as soon as you see the homepage you know you're going to get into some shit</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">like exploring</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">using empty, movable frames as another window metaphor?</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">it was fine to see broken things, just move on to the next one</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">blogposts with secret clues</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">no chaotic, yes chaotic</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">a chaos you can kind of piece together</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">put me in the mindset of a detective, trying to explore</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">don't like to read in games but scrutinizing a 404 page for clues</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">blogposts as characters, wonder if there is some way to connect</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">a beginners guide, get us into the mind of the design</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">eventually you find something that connects everything</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">enjoyed the surprise of just clicking on a link and seeing something unexpected</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">im making my own personal connections, dont know if its right or wrong. my interpretation tho, i like that</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">like visiting an art museum</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">not at all [feeling discomfort]. very intrigued, wanting and wishing i could know more</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">an intangible thing i cant understand completely</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">at some point you decide there are parts you dont understand and that is okay</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">you piece together what you can, the rest is there</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">i don't need all the answers</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">i wanna do this so bad</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">want to see the blog posts in the forest</p>

<p>debrief</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">that is an ultimate goal for me, something comprehensible to a person off the street</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">moving back and forth between games and blogs and games</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">seeing people treat the whole thing as a single thing was cool</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">lots of talk about the introductory exp, accessibility</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">maybe a website/app-style introduction</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">or a myst-style game, familiar interaction patterns</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">too focused on the "this is a process" idea</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">sets up the expectation of impenetrability</p>


</p><p>Something where one person puts in a thing and anohter person can see it-
</p><p>- like a letter
</p><p>A world that evolves (changes "engines") over time
</p><p>- kinda evokes 
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Narrative about blog posts, going from one perspective to the other
</p><p>(Beginners guide)
</p><p>- about being friends and trying to bring soemthign together that's good
</p><p>
</p><p>Starts with game, then has blog posts (or could be the walkthroughs) with dialogue, then has more games,
</p><p>Player watches them come together into something beautiful
</p><p>Things just "happen" - up to player interpretation
</p><p>What brings them together is a "Sense of joy" - from player trying to discover
</p><p>Joy of finding things</p>


<p>how to make it more accesible?
</p><p>an intro screen like in cecile richard games
</p><p>also this idea of slowly easing into the falling-apart or mess or organic side to it (cecile's games start with simple interaction and then get more complex)
</p><p>"you can talk to a live associate at any time" - help bar at the side
</p><p>starting in a 3d world - this is pretty intuitive
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>send messages to other people on the site? like kind words
</p><p>fake messages but also real messages
</p><p>the subtle realization that you are not alone
</p><p>
</p><p>we are straying from our original process idea and that is making bennet uncomfortable
</p><p>should we revisit our seeds?
</p><p>it's still sort of about process but it's not..
</p><p>
</p><p>for narrative. how do we start it? - lets start throwing stuff at a wall in a google doc on friday
</p><p>
</p><p>do we want to do another generate round?
</p><p>presre this idea of individual creativity
</p><p>maybe narrative is good seed for that
</p><p>
</p><p>george and ali seemed to keen to do a similar process (!)
</p><p>i wonder if we can fold them in somehow?
</p><p>just ask for people's repo? include chunks of their game in our game?
</p><p>include javascript hooks in their script? teach them how to use it?</p>
