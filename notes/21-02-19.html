<p>meeting with bennett</p>
<p data-speaker="bennett">event ontology</p>
<p data-speaker="bennett">focus change, user perspective: "i've traveled", "time has changed"</p>
<p data-speaker="bennett">consider how player will read interactions (single/multi window viz, etc.)</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">brainstorm: types of events -> what they trigger physically -> user perceptions</p>
<p data-speaker="bennett">what's your plan here, the way forward</p>
<p data-speaker="bennett">think as unliterally about these problems as you discuss them</p>
<p data-speaker="bennett">internet already embodied, doesn't _need_ to be more literally bodied</p>
<p data-speaker="bennett">manifesto, ontology: some shared thing to get sync'd</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">dark souls deep lore</p>
<p data-speaker="bennett">a perfectly good structure! or a shared politcal thread</p>
<p data-speaker="bennett">if you hit your goals with this the process will be flexible enough to hold multiple different themes</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">grow -> generate -> gather -> ???</p>
<p data-speaker="bennett">set times when we can all push in unison</p>
<p data-speaker="ghost">time to start committing as bfod</p>
<p data-speaker="bennett">explicit cadence</p>
