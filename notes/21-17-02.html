<p data:speaker="ghost">i guess he's pushing us to have more of a gestalt?</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">yeah i think the thing is still moving</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">it'd be cool to have a thing where you can play one game until you get stuck, play another one until you get stuck there, go back</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">interlocking objects, not necessarily puzzles</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">pulling myst where you're pulling levers, theres no real puzzles</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">giving parasols from one game and giving it to frogs in another</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">how the curation on a theme is what makes it more interesting than separate works</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">a gallery of paintings that changes based on the order you observe it</p>
<p data:speaker="bennett">i want the ways in which these experiences are connected to be big, bam, kapow</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">eve, fall into a painting in a gallery, a horror world of paintings. travel through horror world to get back to the gallery as it tries to keep you in. pick who you leave with.</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">and bennett would be there?</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">bennett could be there.</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">individual things could affect not just each other but the overall picture.</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">what really is the overworld?</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">an obvious haunt and that's an impetus to go back and resolve it?</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">mechanize/incentive backtracking, indicate something is amiss here or something has changed</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">could be clicking between the same two pieces and having them change slightly</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">not necessarily our idea of emergent object interactions but still lots of narrative potential</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">making games that are easy spaces to be haunted, making external interactions obvious</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">every opaque thing that happened you can assume it occurred because of something in another game</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">being overdramatic is not necessarily bad thing, "SOMETHING CHANGED" banner</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">YOU HAVE CHANGED THE WEBSITE</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">a strict vocabulary of shared interactions, "using WASD", "clicking and dragging"</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">9-verb monkey island verb grid: pull, stroke</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">not losing sight of: "how does this game affect how i pay attention to this other one, how do they come together?"</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">linear presentation of games that forms a storyline</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">graeme base's 11th hour, ispy, where's waldo type book with an underlying murder mystery</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">border motif, dancing guys</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">some games being decorations, some shared narrative; e.g. the objects are from the same world</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">dark souls, hated, but the story is interesting because it isn't explicitly told. deep lore.</p>
<p data:speaker="ghost">souls-like net art, git gud.</p>
